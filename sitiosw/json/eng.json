    "pt11":"Information technologies (IT) have a significant influence on sustainable development initiatives. It is believed that they can help decrease the impact of industrial and human activities during their development and operation by minimizing the consumption of electric power and other resources. Although technologies to reduce the environmental impact of IT have been developed, particularly hardware-wise, research and development of software technologies that contribute to a sustainable development are only in its initial stages.",
    "pt12":"On a computer, hardware is responsible for electric power consumption. Nonetheless, software oversees hardware operation and facilitates different organizational processes. Therefore, software consumes electric power indirectly. Some investigations have shown that the way software is designed, programmed and displayed has a variable impact on electric power consumption. Software that diminishes its negative impact on the environment and contributes to sustainable development goals is known as green software.",

    "pt16":"Objective",
    "pt17":"To identify software development practices that have a potential positive environmental impact. In this endeavor we’ll focus on application software and the recommended practices will be classified according to the stages of the product life cycle. As a result of this project, a conceptual model of green software improvement practices that considers software life cycle processes will be made."
